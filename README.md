  <h1>What we have here?</h1>

A game like to rock, paper and scissors. Similiar a web chat application. But with a little bit of Sheldon Cooper.
You can read the rules how to play the game typing /info and /command to se all commands avaible in the game.
 
This program is written by a brazilian guy, and some parts its not translated to english. But .. its a stable version. You can clone and do all you want with this project. But the game needs implementation on channel system. All merge request are welcome.


This is inspired by The Big Bang Theory TV serie. This is an online implementation of an algorithm I wrote for a programming proficiency test
